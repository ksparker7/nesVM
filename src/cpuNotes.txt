Zero page refers to addresses in the range $0000-$00FF which is the first page of memory and is used for quick execution

$0000-$07ff are mirrored three times at $0800-$1FFF
This means that any data written to $0000 is also wwritten to $0800, $1000, and $1800. The memory mapped I/O regitsers are located at $2000-$401F.Locations $2000-$2007 are mirrored every 8 bytes in the region $2008-$3FFF and the remaining registers follow this mirroring. SRAM (WRAM) is the Save  RAM, the addresses used to access RAM in the cartridges for storing save games

From $8000 onwards is the addresses allocated to cartridge PRG-ROm. Games with only one 16KB bank of PRG-ROM will load it into both $8000 and $C0000. This is to ensure that the vector table is located in the correct addresses. Games with two 16kb PRG-ROM banks will load one into $8000 and the other into $C000.


Interrupts prevent the standard Sequential execution of code and cause the CPU to attend to the interrupt. Usually generated by hardware which requires attention, but can be triggered by software. The three types of interrupts are NMI, IRQ, and reset. The addresses to jump to when an interrupt occurs are stored in a vector table in the program code at $FFFA-$FFFF. When an interrupt occurs the system performs the following actions
1. recognize an interrupt has occurred
2. Compelte execution of current instruction
3. Push PC and status register on to the stack
4. Set the interrupt disable flag to prevent further interrupts
5. Load the address of the interrupt handling routine from the vector table into the PC
6. Execute the interrupt handling routine
7. After executing a RTI (Return from interrupt) instruction, pull the program counter and status register values from the stack
8. resume execution of the program


PPU - Picture processing unit
The PPU's registers are mostly located in the I/O registers section of CPU memory at $2000-$2007 and $4014

The PPU has its own VRAM with 64KB of memory and 16KB of physical RAM.
Reading and writing to PPU memory is done through I/O registers $2006 and $2007. After each write to $2007 the address is incremented by either 1 or 32 as dictated by bit 2 of $2000
